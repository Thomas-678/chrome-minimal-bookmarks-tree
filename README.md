Minimal Bookmarks Tree is an extension for Google Chrome and can be found in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mohenkbngkbmdlkiemonbgdfgdjacaeb).

## Development

To work on this project you need [NPM][npm].
Once you have that, run

```bash
npm install
```

That will install all dependencies required for this project.

Now you can edit the files in `src/`. When you are happy with your work run

```bash
make build-dev
```

to build a distribution from the sources. This will transpile the ES6 to ES5, compress the CSS,
minify the HTML and copy some vendor files to a distribution. The distribution wil be placed
in a `dist/` folder in the project.
You can add now load the extension in Chrome by going to the [chrome extensions page][chrome-extensions],
tick "Developer mode" and click "Load unpacked extension...". In the file window select the `dist/` directory.

If you want to build for production mode and pack it up into a zip file run `make build` instead.

## Running tests locally
To run the tests locally, run
